## Notes On Styling
use scss for better development and **DO NOT** edit ./assets/css/app.css directly 
ounless you know what you are doing.

to use scss install it as a global
```
npm i -g sass
```

then watch the scss file :
```
cd ./assets/css
sass --watch app.scss app.css
```

use serve to serve the html
```
npm i -g serve
serve -p 5000
```
