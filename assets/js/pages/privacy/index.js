					<h4>Collecting other information on JobLaunch visitors</h4>

This data is always used as aggregated, non-Personal Information, and may be shared with JobLaunch partners to provide them with information relating to how JobLaunch visitors ‘use’ the Site. This is done for the purpose of providing you with the best and most efficient career upskilling opportunities, microjobs and recruitment services.
					</p>
					<p>IP Addresses</p>
					<p>
					JobLaunch's web servers gather your IP address to assist with the diagnosis of problems or support issues with our services, and to monitor the use of our Site, including the monitoring of the location of our users.
					</p>

If you do not wish to have cookies active whilst you browse the Site you can “opt out” by modifying the privacy options in your browser.

					In addition to the above, where users access the JobLaunch mobile applications we use third party software development kits (SDK’s) and services which collect non-Personal Information relating to your use of the JobLaunch Apps, including tracking of app installs and re-engagement. This information is used to tailor and measure advertisements to install and/or use the JobLaunch Apps which appear on third party sites/apps and are targeted towards users’ usage preferences.

					<p>
					<p>Third Party Measurement</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
							The number of page views (or page impressions) that occur on the Site;
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
							The number of unique visitors to the Site;
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
							How long these unique visitors (on average) spend on the Site when they do visit; and
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
							Common entry and exit points into the Site.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					This aggregated, non-Personal Information is collated and provided to JobLaunch to assist in analysing the usage of the Site. This data is also accessible by media organisations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other Internet websites.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Collecting information on Registered Users</h4>
					<p>
					As part of registering with JobLaunch, we collect Personal Information about Registered Users in order for Registered Users to take full advantage of JobLaunch's services. To do this it will be necessary for Registered Users to provide additional information to JobLaunch.
					</p>
					<p>
					Registration
					</p>
					<p>
					Becoming a Registered User allows you to take advantage of more of the tools, services and resources that may assist you in completing a course syllabus or finding a job/microjob. To become a Registered User you will need to submit some Personal Information such as your name and email address. You may access your information at any time by clicking ‘Profile’ on ‘the Site’. JobLaunch may also use this information in order to customise the service we provide to you. For example, JobLaunch may use this information to create a JobLaunch Profile that you may choose to use in the future. However, we will never activate this JobLaunch Profile (or any other service) without your express consent.
					</p>


					<h4>Other information JobLaunch may collect</h4>
					<p>
					JobLaunch may also collect and use information about your job seeking needs, characteristics and priorities by collecting and analysing data about how you use, or interact with, the products and services offered on the Site (including, by way of example, usage patterns around how regularly you update your profile or how often you submit job applications). JobLaunch may use this information, including through automated processes applying algorithms, for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement, including without limitation to better tailor JobLaunch's offerings to your job seeking needs and to provide more targeted services to Candidates including to allow more targeted job opportunities to be surfaced to Candidates.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Storing resumes</h4>
					<p>
					Registered Users may elect to store up to 10 resumes in their ‘Profile’ area, and use those resumes when applying for a job and to supplement their JobLaunch Profile. Deleting a resume from the ‘Profile’ area will mean it is no longer accessible to the Registered User. Deleted records may still be stored by JobLaunch in testing or backup systems for a period of time.
					</p>
					<p>
					Where resumes are held in testing environments, these are held in closed and secure environments and information is only used for the purpose of internal software testing. Information held in backup systems is only held for the purposes of backing up systems in the event of a data loss.
					</p>
					<p>
					If you choose a stored resume as your default resume JobLaunch may use an algorithm that uses that resume, along with other factors, to calculate how you may rate against other candidates in relation to job opportunities that are surfaced to you following a job search or otherwise through JobLaunch products. This assessment may be shown to you when you are viewing a job ad and may also be shown to companies looking to hire as an indication of JobLaunch's assessment of your suitability to a position that an advertiser is trying to fill.
					</p>

					<h4>JobLaunch Profile</h4>
					<p>
					A JobLaunch Profile can include a resume, employment and educational history, contact details, minimum salary expectations, and preferred job classifications and locations. You may populate this information on your JobLaunch Profile or the information may be automatically populated using answers to questions you have provided as part of a job application. You can edit your JobLaunch Profile at any time.
					</p>
					<p>
					Companies are able to search JobLaunch's Profile database to find and contact relevant candidates. Upon registration, all Registered Users will be asked to create a personal JobLaunch Profile (‘JobLaunch Profile’) by providing some key information and selecting one of the privacy settings outlined below. Candidates without JobLaunch Profiles will also be required to create a JobLaunch Profile when they first apply for a job on the Site. Registered Users can elect how much of their JobLaunch Profile they wish to share with Companies in the following ways:
					</p>
					<p>
					In circumstances where Companies are searching to find and contact potential candidates, Registered users can elect one of the following privacy settings:
					</p>
					<p>Standard</p>
					<p>
					If you elect a “Standard” privacy setting for your JobLaunch Profile, then:
					</p>
					<p>
					except for your resume and contact details, your JobLaunch Profile can be seen by Companies searching JobLaunch's talent database;
					</p>
					<p>
					if an Company wishes to purchase access to your JobLaunch Profile, your full JobLaunch Profile including your resume and contact details will be emailed immediately to the relevant Company;
					</p>
					<p>
					an Company may contact you via an external connection Method;
					</p>
					<p>
					if you choose to follow a company within the Company Reviews section of the Site, your JobLaunch Profile, except for your resume and contact details, will be made available to that company; and
					</p>
					<p>
					JobLaunch may parse information from your CV to populate your JobLaunch Profile.
					</p>
					<p>
						Limited
					</p>
					<p>
					If you elect a “Limited” privacy setting for your JobLaunch Profile, then:
					</p>
					<p>
					except for your resume and contact details, your JobLaunch Profile can be seen by Companies searching the JobLaunch database (but Companies cannot purchase your resume and contact details);
					</p>
					<p>
					an Company may contact you via an External Connection Method; and
					</p>
					<p>
					if you choose to follow a company within the Company Reviews section of the Site, your JobLaunch Profile, except for your resume and contact details, will be made available to that company.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hidden
					</p>
					<p>
					If you elect a “Hidden” privacy setting for your JobLaunch Profile, then your JobLaunch Profile is completely hidden (thereby preventing Companies from viewing your JobLaunch Profile).All information provided by you when creating a JobLaunch Profile (including your name, resume, email address, telephone numbers, employment and educational history) may be used by JobLaunch for the purpose of improving placement opportunities for you, syllabus recommendations, microjob recommendations or for tailoring specific products to you.
					</p>
					<p>
					In circumstances where applying for a job opportunity requires some or all of your profile to be sent to the Company, Registered Users are able to amend their JobLaunch Profile prior to applying (see the paragraph “In some circumstances, sending your JobLaunch Profile with an application will be required” below).
					</p>
					<p>
					Registered Users can modify their resume at any time, or modify the privacy options in relation to their JobLaunch Profile at any time, by going to the Profile area of the Site.
					</p>
					<p>
					To delete your JobLaunch Profile you will need to delete your entire account with JobLaunch. JobLaunch reserves the right to disable a JobLaunch Profile at its sole discretion (for example if information is found or believed to be untrue or being stored for improper purposes).
					</p>
					<p>
					Online Applications
					</p>
					<p>
					Submitting an online application for a microjob on JobLaunch is a service that requires Candidates to complete mandatory fields (for example first name, last name, telephone number and email) so that Companies can identify and contact the applicant. When first applying for a microjob, Candidates who do not have a JobLaunch Profile will also be required to create a JobLaunch Profile based on the information contained in their application - you may subsequently edit your JobLaunch Profile. When you apply for a microjob on the Site, applications, including attachments such as cover letters, are forwarded directly on to the Company and/or its nominated representative; 
					</p>
					<p>
					Some companies may also require you to answer a list of questions selected by that Company as part of your microjob application. By answering the Application questions you acknowledge that JobLaunch will provide your answers to that Advertiser and may use your answers to populate your JobLaunch Profile and enable Advertisers to surface that information when using our Talent Search. JobLaunch may also use your answers to improve our products, including through improving our search and matching capabilities.
					</p>
					<p>
					By applying to a position advertised on JobLaunch you are requesting that JobLaunch pass the information you provide to the relevant Advertiser and/or their nominated representative. Any questions you have relating to a position advertised on JobLaunch, your online application and/or the status of your application should be directed directly to the Company or their nominated agent, not JobLaunch. JobLaunch will also retain this information in order to customise the service we provide to Candidates. JobLaunch reserves the right to disable or delete a saved resume or cover letter at its discretion.
					</p>
					<p>
					Companies are asked by JobLaunch to comply with all relevant obligations relating to the use and disclosure of Personal Information that are outlined in the Privacy Act. The use of your information (personal or otherwise) by these Companies is not within the control of JobLaunch and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of these companies.
					</p>
					<p>
					Candidates have the right to directly contact Companies to request access to any Personal Information that you have sent as part of an application or that has been provided to them as part of a JobLaunch Profile.
					</p>
					<p>
					In some circumstances, sending your JobLaunch Profile with a microjob application will be required.
					</p>
					<p>
					In order to apply for some microjob opportunities, some or all of your JobLaunch Profile will be required to be shared with the Advertiser.
					</p>
					<p>
					When this is required, notwithstanding the privacy setting chosen by you when creating your JobLaunch Profile (whether it be Standard, Limited or Hidden as set out above), both your online application and some or all of your JobLaunch Profile (which can include information submitted by you in connection with your employment, educational history, contact details, minimum salary expectations and preferred job classifications and locations) will be shared with the Company.
					</p>
					<p>
					JobLaunch will notify you when your JobLaunch Profile will be part of your application. JobLaunch will also specify which parts of your JobLaunch Profile will be sent to the Company with your application.
					</p>

					JobLaunch collects the company name, business address and billing address of Companies. It also collects the name, email address and phone number of a primary contact (also referred to on the Site as the ‘administrator’).

Companies can change the company name or billing address by emailing accounts@joblaunch.co and can change any other details by emailing contact@joblaunch.co.
