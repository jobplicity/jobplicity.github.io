                <h1>Why use Launch?</h1>
                <p>Have you ever signed up for an online course, hoping to learn something new, but after a while end up forgetting about it & never complete the syllabus? Youâ€™re definitely not alone. On average, students only complete 30% of the content in online courses they pay for, while 96% never look at them again after signing up. Launch solves the problem of staying motivated whilst studying online course content.</p>

                    <p>Ever felt like a university should be paying you to study at it? As you progress through a course, Launch allows you to unlock badges that give access to real world jobs paying real world money. This is a far better incentive to finish a course than a certification piece of paper. This time the paper is real world dollars.</p>
